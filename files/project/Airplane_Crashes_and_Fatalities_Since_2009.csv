01/01/2009,04:37,"Lubock, Texas",Empire Airlines leased from FedEx,8284,Fort Worth - Lubbock,ATR-42-320,b'N902FX',175,2,2,0,"Crashed while attempting to land. The probable cause of this accident was the flight crew's failure to monitor and maintain a minimum safe airspeed while executing an instrument approach in icing conditions, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall at low altitude. Contributing to the accident were 1) the flight crew's failure to follow published standard operating procedures in response to a flap anomaly, 2) the captain's decision to continue with the unstabilized approach, 3) the flight crew's poor crew resource management, and 4) fatigue due to the time of day in which the accident occurred and a cumulative sleep debt, which likely impaired the captain's performance."
01/04/2009,15:30,Near Houma Louisiana,Petroleum Helicopters Inc,,Bayou Penchant - Off shore oil fields,Sikorsky S-76C++,b'N748P',760629,9,8,0,"A helicopter bound for offshore oil fields went down about 75 miles southwest of New Orleans shortly after taking off. The sudden loss of power to both engines that resulted from impact with a red-tailed hawk, which fractured the windshield and interfered with engine fuel controls and the subsequent disorientation of the flightcrrew members. Also the lack of FAA regulations and guidance at the time the helicopter was certificated requiring helicopter windshields to be resistant to bird strikes and the lack of protections that would prevent T-handles from inadvertently dislodging out of the detents and the lack of a master warning light and audible system to alert the flightcrew of low-rotor speed conditions."
