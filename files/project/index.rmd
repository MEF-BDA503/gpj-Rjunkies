# Introduction {#intro}

This project, by **R_Junkies**, is about past airplane crashes, from 1908 to 2017. The project is prepared specifically for BDA 503, 2017, MEF University; course given by [Berk Orbay](http://berkorbay.me/).

# Gathering Data {#gather}

Here is the list of datasets and sources we will be using in this project:

+ Airplane Crashes Since 1908 - Kaggle [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/saurograndi/airplane-crashes-since-1908)
+ Air transport, passengers carried (1970-2016) - World Bank [Link](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=2&series=IS.AIR.PSGR&country=)  
+ Air transport, registered carrier departures worldwide (1970-2016) - World Bank [Link](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=2&series=IS.AIR.DPRT&country=) 
+ Airplane Crashes Since 2009 - Plane Crash Info [Link](http://www.planecrashinfo.com)

Our dataset taken from Kaggle contains crashes from 1908 to mid 2009. In order to analyze data more accurately, we crawled dataset from [http://www.planecrashinfo.com/](http://www.planecrashinfo.com/). With the following Pyhton code, we created a new file contains only data from 2009 to 2017.

## Airplane Crashes

```{r include=TRUE}

# Original Kaggle file
apc_raw_to_2009 <- read.csv(file="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MEF-BDA503/gpj-rjunkies/master/files/project_data/Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_Since_1908.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")

# Data we crawled from PlaneCrashInfo.com
apc_raw_from_2009 <- read.csv(file="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MEF-BDA503/gpj-rjunkies/master/files/project_data/Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_Since_2009.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")

```

## Passengers Carried

```{r include=TRUE}

air_psgr <- read.csv(file="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MEF-BDA503/gpj-rjunkies/master/files/project_data/is_air_psgr_melt.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", quote="\"", na.strings="NA")

```


## Registered Carrier Departures Worldwide

```{r include=TRUE}

# Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

Here are the necessary libraries. We checked if necessary libraries are installed properly.

```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

necessary_lib <- c("stringr","tidyverse","ggthemes","grid","gridExtra","scales","tm","SnowballC","wordcloud","RColorBrewer","plotly","rworldmap")

# Lets check these necessary libraries against already installed packages.
install_lib <- necessary_lib[!(necessary_lib %in% installed.packages())]

if(length(install_lib)!=0){
  install.packages(install_lib)
}

```

Load necessary libraries

```{r echo=TRUE, results=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

lapply(necessary_lib, require, character.only = TRUE)

```

Next, we merge the dataset from Kaggle and the dataset we crawled from PlaneCrashInfo.<br>
Kaggle dataset contains duplicate values for 2009 crashes, so we omit them.

```{r include=TRUE}

apc_raw_to_2009 <-  apc_raw_to_2009 %>%
                    mutate(year=format(as.Date(apc_raw_to_2009$Date, format="%m/%d/%Y"),"%Y")) %>%
                    filter(as.numeric(year) < 2009) %>%
                    select(-year)

# Binding datasets
apc_raw <- rbind(apc_raw_to_2009, apc_raw_from_2009)

```


We first create a new data frame called "apc_clean" which we will manipulate for our analysis.

```{r include=TRUE}

# New data frame
apc_clean <- apc_raw

# Dimensions
dim(apc_clean)

# Get an idea of apc_clean columns
str(apc_clean)

```

There are columns which we can't use for any analysis. These are: "**Flight..**", "**Registration**", "**cn.In**", "**Ground**"

```{r include=TRUE}

# Delete "FLight.." column
apc_clean$Flight.. <- NULL

# Delete "Registration" column
apc_clean$Registration <- NULL

# Delete "cn.In" column
apc_clean$cn.In <- NULL

# Delete "Ground" column
apc_clean$Ground <- NULL

```

Beautiful. We dropped unnecessary columns.<br>
There are some non-UTF-8 characters in some cells. We should remove them.

```{r include=TRUE}

nonutfeight <- apc_clean$Operator
nonutfeight[5315]

apc_clean$Operator  <- gsub("[^\x20-\x7E]", "", nonutfeight)
apc_clean$Operator[5315]

nonutfeight <- NULL

nonutfeight <- apc_clean$Summary
nonutfeight[5249]

apc_clean$Summary  <- gsub("[^\x20-\x7E]", "", nonutfeight)
apc_clean$Summary[5249]


```

Now it's time to reshape time-related columns.

```{r include=TRUE}

# Change date format
apc_clean$Date <- as.Date(apc_clean$Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
typeof(apc_clean$Date)

# Change & clean time format
apc_clean$Time <- gsub('c:', '', apc_clean$Time)
apc_clean$Time <- gsub('c', '', apc_clean$Time)
apc_clean$Time <- factor(as.character(substr(apc_clean$Time, 1, 2)))
typeof(apc_clean$Time)

# New columns for month & year
apc_clean$Year = factor(format(as.Date(apc_clean$Date, format="%Y/%m/%d"),"%Y"))
apc_clean$Month = factor(format(as.Date(apc_clean$Date, format="%Y/%m/%d"),"%m"))

head(apc_clean$Year)
head(apc_clean$Month)

```

We can collect state & city information from "Location" column.

```{r include=TRUE}

# We add new "State" & "City" column
apc_clean$State <- sapply(apc_clean$Location, as.character)
apc_clean$City <- sapply(apc_clean$Location, as.character)

# Seperate State & City
apc_clean$State <- str_trim(gsub(".*,", "", apc_clean$State))
apc_clean$City <- str_trim(gsub(",.*", "", apc_clean$City))

head(apc_clean$State)
head(apc_clean$City)

# Delete unnecessary "Location" column
apc_clean$Location <- NULL

```

Very nice. Now we are going to label flights as "Civilian" or "Military". If "IsMilitary" equals to 1, that means that flight operator is a Military institution, otherwise it is a Civilian flight.

```{r include=TRUE}

military_keywords <- c("Military", "Army", "Navy")
apc_clean$IsMilitary <- ifelse(grepl(paste(military_keywords, collapse = "|"), apc_clean$Operator),1,0)

# Number of Military Flights
sum(apc_clean$IsMilitary)

```

Wonderful. Let's find out how many passengers survived for each crash.

```{r include=TRUE}

apc_clean$Survived <- apc_clean$Aboard - apc_clean$Fatalities
head(apc_clean$Survived)

```

We can determine Source, Destination and number of stops from "Route" column.

```{r include=TRUE}

apc_clean$Source <- gsub(" -.*", "", apc_clean$Route)
apc_clean$Destination <- gsub(".* -", "", apc_clean$Route)
apc_clean$Stops <- str_count(apc_clean$Route,"-")-1

# Number of flights with no Stops
length(which(apc_clean$Stops==0))

# Number of flights with no Route information
length(which(apc_clean$Stops<0))

# Number of flights with Stops
length(which(apc_clean$Stops>0))

```

Lastly, we reordered the columns in apc_clean data frame.

```{r include=TRUE}

apc_clean <- apc_clean[,c(1,2,9,10,11,12,3,13,4,15,16,17,5,6,7,14,8)]

# Latest structure of apc_clean
str(apc_clean)

```

# Exploratory Analytics of APC {#eda}

## Explaining the Dataset & Variables

**Dataset**:
Airplane crashes from 1908 to 2017. Contains 17 variables, with 5.543 observations.

Here are the variables in our Airplane Crashes dataset and their explanations:

+ **Date**: The date of airplane crash.
+ **Time**: The time of airplane crash in hh format.
+ **Year**: The year of airplane crash.
+ **Month**: The month of airplane crash.
+ **State**: This field shows the country in which airplane crash happened.
+ **City**: This field shows the city in which airplane crash occured.
+ **Operator**: This field contains the airline information.
+ **IsMilitary**: This field shows whether an operator is a military institution or civilian. It conveys binary results (1=Military, 0=Civilian).
+ **Route**: This field contains the  departure, arrival and transfer location of the flight. There are both direct and connecting flights.
+ **Source**: This field shows the city where the airplane took-off.
+ **Destination**: This field shows the destination city.
+ **Stops**: This field demonstrates the number of transfer cities for connecting flights.
+ **Type**: This field contains the information of the airplane type.
+ **Aboard**: This field shows the number of passengers at the time of departure.
+ **Fatalities**: This field shows the number of passengers died after airplane crash.
+ **Survived**: This field shows the number of passengers survived after airplane crash.
+ **Summary**: This field contains information about the airplane crash and possible reasons.

## Objectives

+ Understanding statistics and characteristics of past airplane crashes

+ Visualizing results of exploratory analysis

+ Demonstrating geolocations of airplane crashes on a static map

+ Developing and demonstrating R & RMarkdown skills of **R_Junkies**

## Questions

We studied most of the kernels on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/saurograndi/airplane-crashes-since-1908/kernels). Majority of the them are not very sophisticated and don't even go beyond basic descriptive analytics. We hope that at the end of our research, we can share our findings on Kaggle. :)
<br><br>

+ **Question 1:**
How many passengers died in airplane crashes since 1908?
<br>
+ **Question 2:**
Which airplanes have most records of crashes so far?
<br>
+ **Question 3:**
How many accidents occured, compared to number of departures over years?
<br>
+ **Question 4:**
Which civil operators have the most records of accidents and fatalities?
<br>
+ **Question 5:**
What is the crash history of Turkish Airlines?
<br>
+ **Question 6:**
Have airplane flights gotten more secure over time?
<br>
+ **Question 7:**
Has survival rate of a single airplane crash increased over time?
<br>
+ **Question 8:**
What are the causes of airplane crashes?
<br>
+ **Question 9:**
In which countries the most airplane accidents occured?
<br><br>

## EDA

### Total Fatalities Over Years

Let's find out how many passengers died over years.

```{r include=TRUE}

total_fatalities <- apc_clean %>% 
  filter(IsMilitary==0) %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(total_fat=sum(Fatalities)) %>%
  mutate(total_fat = ifelse(is.na(total_fat), 0, total_fat))


ggplot(total_fatalities, aes(x=Year,y=total_fat,group = 1)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=total_fat), size=0.5, alpha=1, colour="#7a1c1c") +
  geom_area(fill = "lightblue") +
  ggtitle("Fatalities of Civil Flights Over Years") +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste(as.character(round(total_fat/1000,1)), "K")), check_overlap = TRUE, size=2.7, colour = "black", angle=30,nudge_y = -40) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = levels(total_fatalities$Year)[c(T, rep(F, 5))]) +
  theme (axis.text.x=element_text (angle=60,vjust=1, hjust=1)) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=11),
         axis.text=element_text(size=8)) +
  labs(x = "Years", y = "Fatalities")

```

As we can see, until 90's the trend increases, but later it seems to decline: Less passengers died in airplane crashes.

        group_by(Operator, Year, Month) %>%

         xaxis = list(showgrid = FALSE),
         yaxis = list(showgrid = FALSE),
         showlegend = TRUE)

p

```


### Fatalities Over Total Passengers By Years

The ratio of fatalities over total passengers is important. We want to see the relation between passengers carried and passengers died over the time.

```{r include=TRUE}


Total_Passenger_Byyears <- air_psgr %>% 
                   filter(!is.na(Value)) %>% 
                   group_by(Time) %>% 
                   summarize(Value=sum(Value)) %>%
                  mutate(Year = as.character(Time),Passengers = Value) %>%
                  select(-Time,-Value)

Total_Fatalities_Byyears <- apc_clean %>% 
            filter(IsMilitary==0) %>% 
            group_by(Year) %>%
            summarize(TotalFatalities = sum(Fatalities)) %>%
            mutate(TotalFatalities = ifelse(is.na(TotalFatalities), 0, TotalFatalities))

Total_Fatalities_Byyears$Year = as.character(Total_Fatalities_Byyears$Year)


death <- inner_join(Total_Passenger_Byyears,Total_Fatalities_Byyears, by = "Year")

death <-death %>%
            mutate(DRate = TotalFatalities/Passengers*1000000)


ggplot(death, aes(x=Year,y=DRate,group = 1)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=DRate), size=0.5, alpha=1, colour="#7a1c1c") +
  ggtitle("Fatalities Over Total Passengers By Years") +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = levels(total_fatalities$Year)[c(T, rep(F, 5))]) +
  theme (axis.text.x=element_text (angle=60,vjust=1, hjust=1)) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=11),
         axis.text=element_text(size=8)) +
  labs(x = "Years", y = "Rate")
```

It is very clear that more passengers were carried, but less passengers died over years. It's a good sign of increase in flight security.

### Has Survival Rate Increased Over Time?
 
```{r include=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

# Survival Rate
dataSurvival <- apc_clean %>% 
   filter(as.numeric(as.character(Year)) >= 1900 & Aboard > 0) %>%
   group_by(Year) %>%
   summarize(TotalFatalities=sum(Fatalities), 
             TotalAboard=sum(Aboard),
             SurvivalRate=round(100*(TotalAboard-TotalFatalities)/TotalAboard,2),
             Survival = (TotalAboard-TotalFatalities),
             TotalAccident = n())
 
# Normalizer for dual-y axis
n <- max(dataSurvival$TotalAccident) /max(dataSurvival$SurvivalRate)
 
ggplot(dataSurvival, aes(y=SurvivalRate, x=Year)) +  
   geom_col(aes(y=TotalAccident/n), fill = "#2780E3") +
   geom_line(aes(group = 1), size=0.7, alpha=1, colour = "#7a1c1c") +
   geom_smooth(aes(group = 1), colour = "black") +
   scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(trans= ~.*n, name = 'Total Accidents')) + 
   scale_x_discrete(breaks = levels(dataSurvival$Year)[c(T, rep(F, 3))]) +
   
   theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60, vjust=1, hjust=1, size=8))
   
   
```
 
We observed that "Survival Rate" was very low in early 1900's and increased over time. The trend reverts after beginning of millenium.


### Possible Causes of Crashes - Word Cloud

For each accident, there is an explanation in "Summary" column. By looking at this summary information, we tried to visuailize a word cloud.
 
```{r include=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
 
 text <- apc_clean$Summary
 
 docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(text))
 
 toSpace <- content_transformer(function (x , pattern ) gsub(pattern, " ", x))
 docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, "/")
 docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, "@")
 docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, "\\|")
 
 docs <- tm_map(docs, PlainTextDocument)
 
 # Convert text to lower case
 docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
 
 # Remove numbers
 docs <- tm_map(docs, removeNumbers)
 
 # Remove english common stopwords
 docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords("english"))
 
 # Remove punctuations
 docs <- tm_map(docs, removePunctuation)
 
 # Eliminate extra white spaces
 docs <- tm_map(docs, stripWhitespace)
 
 # Text stemming
 docs <- tm_map(docs, stemDocument)
 
 # Remove possible words that high frequency in text that no meaning for crash reason
 # (After first try in word cloud, we realize that these words are the most frequent one)
 docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, c("aircraft", "plane","flight", "crash","crashed")) 
 
 dtm <- TermDocumentMatrix(docs)
 
 ##Remove sparse terms
 removeSparseTerms(dtm, 0.95)
 m <- as.matrix(dtm)
 v <- sort(rowSums(m),decreasing=TRUE)
 d <- data.frame(word = names(v),freq=v)
 #head(d, 10)
 
 set.seed(1234)
 wordcloud(words = d$word, freq = d$freq, min.freq = 1,
           max.words=200, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.35, 
           colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))
```

### Most Frequent 10 Words

Here are the most frequent 10 words, which may show the reason why the accident happened.

```{r include=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

#Top 10 Word frequencies
ggplot(d[1:10,], aes(x=reorder(word, -freq), y=freq)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#2780E3") +
  labs(title="Top 10 Word frequencies",x="Words",y="Frequency",fill="") +
  theme (axis.text.x=element_text (angle=60,vjust=1, hjust=1))

#How words associated with others. so we can understand causes 
i <- 1

while (i < 6) {
  print (findAssocs(dtm, terms = as.character(d[i,]$word), corlimit = 0.3))
  i = i+1
}

```

### Where do accidents occur?

We prepare a world map that shows dangerous countries for flights.

```{r include=TRUE}

                        , legendLabels="all"
                        , legendIntervals="page"
))

```

USA, Russia and Brazil seem to be the most dangerous places not to travel via plane!

# Conclusion

We tried to answer 9 questions prepared for airplane crashes dataset. It seems that there are less airplane crashes nowadays. We hope that they will never happen in near & far future. :)
<br><br>
You are welcome to ask any questions or give suggestions. Thanks to Berk Orbay for his contributions and his instant replies. He enabled us to develop our coding skills.

# Future Research Suggestions

+ More cleaning of "Route", "Source" & "Destination" variables, using advanced string manipulation, since there are some edge cases
+ More cleaning of "State" variable, since we can't show all crashes on world map
+ Adding "Ground" variable (Non-passenger people died on the ground) to analysis
+ Dynamic Map of Airplane Crashes, using Shiny
+ Most dangerous routes as lines on world-map
+ Predicting crash possibility of a flight using Machine Learning tools

We got a lot of help from danielviray's kernel in order to accomplish data preprocessing, but we used a different approach and generated our own columns.
