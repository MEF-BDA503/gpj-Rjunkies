## Objective:

In this paper, we analyze the causes of aviation accidents that occured worlwide between 1909 from 2017. Base for this analyze is in this [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/saurograndi/airplane-crashes-since-1908). Data we analyze contains date, location of accidents, which fligts, what it's route and  type of plane and other information about flights. 

In order to answer below questions We'd like to enrich data by using different [sources](#DataReferences)

By analyzing we'd like answer following questions (*list is not finalized*)

- Cause of Airplane Crashes
- How many people dies in each year?
- How many plane crashed in each year?
- People dead/alive in crashes
- Top 100 worst plane crash
- Top plane crash involving Turkey Carriers
- Plane Types
- Fatalities by Phase of Flight..
