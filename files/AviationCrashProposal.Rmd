## Objective:

In this paper, we analyze the causes of aviation accidents that occured worlwide between 1909 from 2017. Base for this analyze is in this page [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/saurograndi/airplane-crashes-since-1908). 
Data we analyze contains date, location of accidents, which fligts, what it's route and type of plane and other information about flights. 

In order to answer below questions We'd like to enrich data by using different [sources](#DataReferences)

By analyzing we'd like answer following questions (*list is not finalized*)

- Cause of Airplane Crashes
- Fatalities by Phase of Flight
- People dead/alive in crashes
- How many people dies in each year?
- How many plane crashed in each year?
- Top 100 worst plane crash
- Top plane crash involving Turkey Carriers
- Crash Trend by Plane Types

## Dataset

Dataset contains 5268 observations and 13 variables.
