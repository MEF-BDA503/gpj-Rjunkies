## Dataset: Airplane Crashes | from 1908 to 2017
After collecting & preprocessing the dataset contains:<br><br>
**17** variables<br>
**5.543** observations<br><br>

Airplane Crashes Since 1908 - Kaggle<br>
Air transport, passengers carried (1970-2016) - World Bank<br>
Air transport, registered carrier departures worldwide (1970-2016) - World Bank<br>
Airplane Crashes Since 2009 - Plane Crash Info<br><br>

* Crashes after 2009 were crawled from PlaneCrashInfo.com, using Python.

## Objectives

+ Understanding statistics and characteristics of past airplane crashes
+ Visualizing results of exploratory analysis
+ Demonstrating geolocations of airplane crashes on a static map
+ Developing and demonstrating R & RMarkdown skills of R_Junkies

## Questions

+ How many passengers died in airplane crashes since 1908? 
+ Which airplanes have most records of crashes so far? 
+ How many accidents occured, compared to number of departures over years? 
+ Which civil operators have the most records of accidents and fatalities? 
+ What is the crash history of Turkish Airlines? 
+ Have airplane flights gotten more secure over time? 
+ Has survival rate of a single airplane crash increased over time? 
+ What are the causes of airplane crashes? 
+ In which countries the most airplane accidents occured?
